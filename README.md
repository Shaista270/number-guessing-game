A simple Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly selected number between 1 and 100.

## 💡 How It Works

- The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- The user is asked to guess the number.
- The program provides feedback:
  - "Too low" if the guess is less than the number.
  - "Too high" if the guess is more than the number.
  - "Congratulations!" when the user guesses correctly.
- The game also tells how many attempts it took.
